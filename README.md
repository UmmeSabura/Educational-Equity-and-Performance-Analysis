I completed a study on educational equity and performance analytics that examined how student behavior, parental education, and prior educational attainment affect educational outcomes. I highlighted at-risk groups who may need special support and identified important predictors of student success through statistical analysis, regression modeling, and data visualization.

The results of this work directly inform the design of equitable, AI-powered assessment tools. By emphasizing the importance of early intervention, bridging historical learning gaps, and supporting students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the project provides actionable insights for educational practice.

Finally, by integrating data analysis with the promise of social impact, this research advances my commitment to equity-focused intervention development and evidence-based education policymaking.
